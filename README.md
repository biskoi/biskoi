Hello! I'm a full stack web developer who is currently working with Lambda School as one of their team leads. I'm currently seeking out offers where I can further develop myself, my technical abilities, and help others along the way.

While Javascript may be my strongest programming language, I recently picked up Python and am thoroughly enjoying it so far. I'm looking forward to all the cool things I'll learn with the language.

Things I've worked with in the past include:

  # Basics
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - LESS/SCSS
    - Javascript
    - Python
    - Deploying web applications/APIs
  
  # React Frontend
    - Router
    - Redux (Thunk)
    - Context API
    - Custom hooks
    - Validation with Yup
    - Jest.js
    
  # Node.js Backend
    - REST APIs
    - Express.js
    - Knex.js
    - Validation with Yup
    - Authentication (Tokens/Cookies/3rd-party)
    - RDBMS (SQL, PostgreSQL)
    
  # Data structures
    - Stacks, Queues
    - Binary trees
    - Hashtables
    - Graphs
